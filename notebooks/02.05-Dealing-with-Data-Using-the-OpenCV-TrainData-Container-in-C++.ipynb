    "In C++, all of OpenCV's machine learning functionality is contained in a separate module called <tt>ml</tt>. Among other things, this module contains a class called <tt>TrainData</tt>, which provides a container to work with data in C++. Its functionality is limited to reading (preferrably) numerical data from .csv files (containing comma-separated values). Hence, if the data you want to work with already comes in a neatly organized .csv file, this class will save you a lot of time. If your data comes from a different source, I'm afraid you're on your own."
